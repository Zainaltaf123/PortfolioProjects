The SQL code consists of several queries that retrieve and manipulate data from two tables, 
`CovidDeaths` and `CovidVacination`, which contain data about Covid-19 cases, deaths, and 
vaccinations across different locations and time periods. The queries include:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A query that retrieves the maximum number of deaths by continent.

A commented-out query that retrieves all columns from the CovidVacination table.

A query that retrieves specific columns from the CovidDeaths table and sorts the results by location and date.

A query that calculates the death percentage and retrieves specific columns from the CovidDeaths table for a specific country (Pakistan).

A query that calculates the percentage of population infected with Covid-19 and retrieves specific columns from the CovidDeaths table for
all locations and sorts the results by location and date.

A query that retrieves the highest infection count and the percentage of population infected with Covid-19 for each location and sorts the
results by the percentage of population infected.

A query that retrieves the highest death count for each location and sorts the results by the total death count.

A query that retrieves the highest death count by continent and sorts the results by the total death count.

A query that retrieves the total number of cases, deaths, and death percentage globally, sorted by the number of cases and deaths.

A query that calculates the percentage of the population that has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine and retrieves specific columns 
from the CovidDeaths and CovidVacination tables for all locations and sorts the results by location and date.

Two queries that use a common table expression (CTE) and a temporary table, respectively, to calculate the percentage of the population 
that has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine and retrieve specific columns from the CovidDeaths and CovidVacination tables for all locations 
and sort the results by location and date.

A query that creates a view called PercentPopulationVaccinated that retrieves the data used in the previous queries and stores it for later visualization
